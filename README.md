# Bhavik's New Portfolio 

This is my new portfilio built with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Aceternity Ui, and Flowbite-react. 

I built this portfolio website to showcase my resume, projects, and photography. The site is developed using Next.js and React, styled with TailwindCSS, and utilizes components from PrimeReact and AceternityUI. It is built with Github Actions and hosted by GitHub pages. It features a dynamic carousel to display my projects, and sections dedicated to my professional experience, personal interests, and contact information.
